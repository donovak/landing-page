# landing-page

Second project for The Odin Project.

Recreating a given landing page template using html and css with a focus on flexbox.

Overall, felt pretty comfortable getting everything together and managed to include some adjustments for mobile support which is not part of the main project. 

However, both the html and css ended up fairly cluttered and could probably be cut down significantly with better usage of selectors, and better planning of the structure in general. Things like padding, margins and spacing in general could also be more consistent; currently just use whatever comes to mind at the time.

Could do with more git commits, often ended up adding lots of new parts before realising to commit anything.
